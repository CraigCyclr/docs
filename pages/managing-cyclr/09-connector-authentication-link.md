If you require one of your clients to authenticate an Account Connector, but they don't have access to Cyclr and don't wish to share their credentials with you, you can generate a **Connector Authentication Link**.

This is a link that can be emailed and will take anyone clicking it through the authentication screens of a particular Account Connector.

To generate a Connector Authentication Link:

* go to your Cyclr Console then the **Accounts** menu and **Account Management**.
* navigate to the appropriate account and take the **Open Account** button.
* from the main navigation select **Connectors**.
* navigate to the appropriate connector and take the **Edit Connector** button.
* take the **Generate Setup Token" buttom
* set a date for the Link Expires After value and click Generate.

You'll then be given a URL you can send to someone to authenticate the Account Connector.

*Note: This link will only function **once** so after being clicked the first time, the link will no longer work.*

*If emailing the link, be aware that spam filters may perform the click as part of scanning an email so you may need to split the link into multiple pieces or send the link through other means.*
