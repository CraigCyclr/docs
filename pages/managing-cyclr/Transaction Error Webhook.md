Cyclr can be set to make an HTTP request when there is an issue with an account's cycles, or an error occurs in a transaction.

**Setting up the Webhook**

1. Create a special folder called for example "Monitoring".  It's up to you if you wish to create this in your template folder, or in one of your accounts.
2. Install the **Error Webhook Connector** - it has a Webhook Method which knows the structure of Cyclr's error Requests.
3. Add that Connector's Webhook Step to your Cycle.
4. In the Webhook's Step Setup, copy the `Webhook URL`.
5. Go into your Console, and select `Settings` > `General Settings`.
6. Tick the box for `Enable Transaction Error Webhook`
7. Paste in the URL you copied in Step 4.
8. Click Save.

Now you can go back to the Cycle/Template where you added the webhook step, and add Decision Steps to filter the output of the webhook. You can then decide how and where you wish to be alerted about the error.

In the example below, any errors relating to "Account 12345" will trigger a message in Slack.
