      - text: Many integrations are triggered when details of an updated record in one application are sent to a second application to keep the data in sync.
      - text: There are occasions when this process needs to be bi-directional and this can result in an infinite cross-updating loop where System A updates System B, which causes System B to update System A, and so on.  This continual triggering of updates isn't useful and will eat into your monthly Task Allowance, as well as cause unnecessary updates in both systems.
      - text: The Cyclr **Cross Updating Preventer** (or "XUP" for short) is designed to avoid this situation.  It can be used to make sure that an inbound update to an application does not result in a returning outbound update.
